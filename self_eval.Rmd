I was definitely challenged in this class, hence the gif of encouragement that I am a grown woman & I can figure it out. I learned a ton of new statistical analyses & now better understand the reasons behind using the ones that I was previously familiar with. I think one of best things I gained was proper R markdown experience, this should be useful in helping others replicate my work in the future.

##Instructions

***

Please download this Markdown file (`selfevaluation.Rmd`) from my GitHub site (in the `fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/` folder) and answer the appropriate questions in the spaces provided. Once you've knitted the final file, please *email* the **html** version of that file to me with the name `[LastF]_F19_SelfEvaluation.html` (with `LastF` meaning your last name followed by your first initial, i.e., mine would be called `SchmittC_F19_SelfEvaluation.html`). I must receive this file by **Midnight of December 17, 2019**.

###Overall Impression

***

In place of my name as author on this Markdown file, please insert your own, along with the date on which you completed this self-assessment. In place of the RuPaul GIF, above, please choose a GIF of a drag queen that best exemplifies your overall feelings about what you learned/accomplished in this course. Additionally, replace the `The following self evaluation...` text below your GIF with a three sentence summary of your experience in the class and what you take away from it to accompany that GIF. You may also choose a catchy title.

###How well did you accomplish them?

***

Please let me know how well you feel you accomplished your tasks, in a general sense. What do you feel you did the best, and what did you do the least well? What was the hardest part for you? Did your work/understanding/ease improve over the course of the semester?<br><br><br><br><br><br>
